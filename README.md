This repo is about a guess the number game. There you can select a number between 1 and 20 and the goal is to guess the number. Every time you type a number the programm will tell you if the number you checked is lower or higher than the mysterious number. Also, you have a score starting at 20 and everytime you fail to guess the number the score is going to decrease by 1. Highscore is another feature of the game. Ð¢he less attempts you use to guess the number the higher is going to be your highscore. 
Enjoy the game :)
